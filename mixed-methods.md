This supplement is a work on progress! 
Feedback on the following proposed standard supplement is kindly requested, before Feb 21, 2021 
(see the [README](README.md))


#  Multi-Methodology and Mixed Methods Research (Supplement)

<em>Multi-Methodology includes the use of more than one 
research methodology or method in a study to corroborate, 
complement and expand research findings. 
Mixed method research may 
combine and integrate inductive research and 
deductive research and may mix methods that rely on 
qualitative and/or quantitative data.</em>


## Application

This standard applies to software engineering studies that use multi-methodology, 
multi-method or mixed method research designs. This guideline should be 
complemented by guidelines elsewhere in this guide for the specific methods 
used when available.  Multi-methodology, multiple method and mixed method 
research may be used in case study research, design studies, experiments, 
theoretical studies and evaluations to corroborate, complement, and expand 
research findings.
Mixed method research may
combine and integrate inductive research and
deductive research and may mix methods that rely on
qualitative and/or quantitative data.

## Specific Attributes

#### Essential:

- **justifies** the use of multiple methodologies and/or methods in the research 
  study and provides a **purpose statement** that conveys the overarching multi or 
  mixed method design intent (why)
- describes the **multi-methodology**, **multi-method** or **mixed method** design (what) 
- describes **which phases** of the research study the different methods or 
  methodologies are used in (when)
- describes how the design aligns with the research question or objective
- **meets the guidelines** for the main methods reported in the design (including 
  sampling procedures, data collection, data analysis procedures, validation 
  and limitations)
- describes and justifies **sample reuse** (or no reuse, or partial reuse) across 
  methods
- provides a **narrative** of the final study that aligns with the type of 
  multi-methodology or mixed method design used
- **integrates the findings** from all methods to address the research 
  question/objective
- **distinguishes the additional value** from using a multi-methodology or mixed 
  method design (in terms of corroboration, complementarity, and expansion 
  (breadth and depth))
- discusses **discrepancies and incongruent findings** from the use of multiple 
  methods
- considers the **limitations** associated with the integration of findings 
  (e.g., the qualitative and quantitative data (or results) in a triangulation design)
 
#### Desirable:

- provides a basic **definition** of multi-methodology and the mixed method 
  design used (if a mixed method design is used)
- provides a **visual model** (diagram) that illustrates the research design
- provides a **title** that foreshadows the use of multiple methods or mixed 
  method design in the study
- provides an **abstract and introduction** that describes the methods used 
  and the intent of integration
- provides a **literature review** that describes related quantitative, 
  qualitative, and mixed methods studies that relate to the research (desirable 
  in the case of a mixed method design)

#### Extraordinary: 

- describes the main **philosophical, epistemological, and/or theoretical 
  foundations** that the authors use and relate those to the planned use of 
  multi or mixed methods in the study 
- describes how the methods and their findings relate to one or more **theories 
  or theoretical frameworks**
- describes the **challenges** faced in the design and how those were or could be 
  mitigated
- describes **ethical issues** that may have been presented through the blend of 
  multi- or mixed methods


## General Quality Criteria

General quality criteria discussed in the guidelines for each method should be 
considered.  In the case of a multi-methodology or multi-method design, the 
reliability of the findings that are specific to the triangulation goals should 
be assessed.  In the case of a mixed method design, the research may also 
require a “legitimation step to assess the trustworthiness of both the 
qualitative and quantitative data and subsequent interpretations” 
[Johnson/On., P. 22].

## Antipatterns

- **Uninvited guest:** A research method is not clearly introduced in the paper 
  introduction/methodology and makes an unexpected entrance in the discussion or 
  limitations sections of the paper
- **Smoke and mirrors:** Overselling a study as a multi-methodology or mixed method design 
  when one study at best offers a token or anecdotal contribution to the research motivation 
  or findings
- **Selling your soul:** Employing an additional method to appeal to a methodological purist 
  during the review process that does not contribute substantively to the research findings
- **Integration failure:** Poor integration of findings from all methods used
- **Limitation shirker**: Failure to discuss limitations from all methods used or from their 
  integration
- **Missing the mark:** Misalignment of multi- or mixed method design with the research 
  question/objective
- **Cargo cult research:** Using methods where the research team lacks expertise in those methods, 
  but hopes they work
- **Design by committee:** Failure to agree on a crisp research question/objective that may have 
  been induced by different epistemological perspectives or use of heterogeneous methods
- **Golden hammer:** Researchers with a stronger quantitative background may be inclined to rely 
  on counts from the qualitative study losing richness from their qualitative data
- **Sample contamination:** reusing a participant sample from one method in another method in a 
  mixed method sequential design without accounting for potential contamination from an 
  earlier method
- **Ignoring the writing on the wall:** In a mixed method sequential design, failure to use 
  findings from an earlier study when forming an instrument for a study in a later phase of 
  the research

## Examples of Acceptable Deviations

- Conference page limits may make it particularly challenging to share sufficient details 
  on all methods used. These details may be available in other publications or supplementary 
  materials.  
- The other guidelines should be consulted in terms of acceptable deviations for the 
  various methods used.


## Invalid Criticisms

- In the case of non-equal research designs, rejecting the paper on the basis of 
  limitations of a minor method (e.g., few participants) is not a fatal flaw. 
- See the guidelines for the other methods used.


## Notes

- The distinction between quantitative and qualitative research should not be conflated with
  qualitative and quantitative data alone.  Quantitative research is used by many authors to
  refer to deductive research (and
  more often relies on quantitative data) while qualitative research is inductive research
  (which more often relies on qualitative research).
- Multi-methodology research is sometimes referred to as multi-method, blended research, 
  and integrative research (see P. 118 Johnson 2008).  Mixed method research is 
  sometimes seen as a special case of multi-methodology research that blends 
  deductive and inductive research, or mixes methods that rely on quantitative 
  and qualitative data. 
- The terms “methodology” and “method” are frequently used interchangeably. In mixed method 
  research, the term method often refers to methodology, not just a data collection method.
- For multi-method research, it is important to distinguish between using different methods 
  of collecting data (e.g., as part of an inductive case study) to using different research 
  strategies (e.g., complementing an inductive case study with a deductive experiment in a 
  later stage of the research).
- Some experts on mixed methods use specific terms to refer to core mixed method designs 
  (e.g, Convergent mixed methods, Explanatory sequential mixed methods, Exploratory sequential 
  mixed methods are defined by Creswell & Creswell, 2007 and Quantitatively driven approaches/designs, 
  Qualitatively driven approaches/designs, Interactive or equal status designs are used by 
  Johnson, Onwuegbuzie, & Turner, 2007).

# Mixed Methods Supplement for the SIGSOFT Standards

I've offered to help out the SIGSOFT standards project by writing a first draft of a standard
for the supplement on mixed methods or multi-methodology research.  
I would love to hear your opinions and comments and your suggestions for changes! 
If you have a comment, please use the issues feature to start a discussion. 

If you would like to suggest a change or suggest an example paper (or update the existing papers!), please consider forking this repo and open a pull request.
More examples of papers that use mixed methods would be fantastic!
